## 🛠 How the Caesar Cipher Works
1. **Take each letter** in your message.
2. **Find its position** in the alphabet using the `.find()` method.
3. **Shift the position** by `+3` in the alphabet.
4. **Replace** the original letter with the new shifted letter.
 
## 🚀 Goals
By completing this project, you will:
- Practice core Python syntax and logic
- Understand how string indexing works
- Learn a basic encryption method
- Build your confidence as a beginner Python programmer
